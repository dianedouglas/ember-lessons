//component is two parts: handlebars template that is the display and a js source file defining behavior.
//components must have a dash. rental not ok. rental-tile is ok.
//we generate a new route when it's a new url. a component is a piece of the functionality on one part of the page. can put it on any url by instantiating it in a template.
